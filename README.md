# Titanic_Survival-Prediction
Its a basic machine learning model used to predict whether a particular person survived in Titanic or not.
The dataset is downloaded from kaggle.
I used several models and got the accuracy score of: 

KNeighborsClassifier()' -> 0.6363636363636364.
DecisionTreeClassifier()' -> 0.7033492822966507'.
LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)' -> 0.9354066985645934.
RandomForestClassifier()' -> 0.8086124401913876. 
So I chose Logistic regression with 93.54% accuracy.
